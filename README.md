<h1>Hi, I'm James!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I live in Austin, Texas, but grew up in Connecticut. I am new to the tech world, and am currently a student of Columbia University's Justice Through Code Program! I currently have an Associate's Degree in Business Management. Once I complete my studies with Columbia University, I intent to return to school to get my Bachelor's Degree</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>My #1 hobby is traveling, although I don't do it as much as I would like to. I definetely enjoy any type of travel even if it is just a quick weekend getaway. But ultimately, what makes my heart smile is traveling to other countries and immersing myself in other cultures.</p>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>I have no previous technical experience. I currently work as an Event Manager for a catering company. The majority of my professional experience has been in sales.</p>

<h2>The Future!</h2>
<p>My future goals are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finish all 3 Phases of Justice Through Code</li>
  <li>Return to school to get my Bachelor's Degree</li>
  <li>Land a job in Cyber Security with my dream company: CrowdStrike</li>
  <li>Continue exploring the world!</li>
</ul>
